# control.py
A script that can be used to automate commands in battle. Currently, the tool uses PyAutoGUI and PYGetWindow to get the client, and automate key/mouse movements. It takes in one argument, and selects an appropriate action based on what state the tool is currently in.

# voiceControl.py
An extension of the script using speech_recognition, allowing for a hands-free control scheme in Corporate Clash's battle menu.
